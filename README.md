# Blue Bank Loan Analysis
Blue Bank is a bank in the USA that has a loan department that is currently understaffed.
They supply loans to individuals and donâ€™t have much reporting on how risky these
borrowers are.

Using Python and Tableau, I created a dashboard to report the borrowers who may have issues paying back the loan to Blue Bank.
